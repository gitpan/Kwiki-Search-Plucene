Kwiki::Search::Plucene

This plugin is intend to be an alternative of Kwiki::Search,
which use a simple 'grep' upon search, and will be slow
after the number of pages grow larger and larger.

It use Plucene::Simple to index page content upon saving.
Plucene is a Perl port of the Lucene search engine.
